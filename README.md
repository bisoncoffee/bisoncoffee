## Hi there 👋

<!--
**bisoncoffee/bisoncoffee** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a local chess game with stockfish integrated @ https://github.com/bisoncoffee/chessBoard and sound to musical note/chord structure @ https://github.com/bisoncoffee/chordLyzer
